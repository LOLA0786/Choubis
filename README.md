## 🚀 Why Choubis?

In 2026, AI Technical Debt and Shadow AI are the biggest structural risks to enterprises. Choubis provides a three-pillar defense:

* **📜 Choubis Ledger**: An immutable, cryptographic "Reasoning Trace" recorded to your Context Graph. Essential for agentic insurance and legal audit trails.
* **💓 Choubis Pulse**: Continuous adversarial stress testing using **AIPersonas** to simulate hostile regulatory audits before they happen.
